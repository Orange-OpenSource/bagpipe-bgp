Note: this project has moved !
==============================

This software is now developed as part of the networking-bagpipe_
Openstack project, and **not developed actively here in this github repo**.

It can however still be used standalone independently of OpenStack.

You are encouraged
to fill bugs at `https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-bagpipe` and to
contribute following the Openstack guidelines_.

Please join us on #bagpipe on ``irc.freenode.net`` to discuss this.
